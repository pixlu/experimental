# experimental
Here you can find stuff that I do randomly, in my free time. I use Visual Studio Code to do this kind of stuff. :]

Anyways... all of the stuff I share here are tested before uploading, so it should work, however, sometimes it may not, who knows? lol

I try my best to create new stuff, but I often need to work on other interesting things.
